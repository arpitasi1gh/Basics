        🎨 Welcome to the World of Design Tools!
        <br><br><br>
        Ready to unlock your creativity and start designing like a pro? Let’s step into the exciting world of design —
        where ideas come to life on screen.
        <br><br><br>
        From websites to mobile apps, everything you interact with digitally has been crafted using design tools. There
        are plenty of options out there — Adobe XD, Sketch, Webflow, and more. But in this course, we’re going to focus
        on one amazing tool: Figma ✨
        <br><br><br>
        Why Figma?
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Free for individual use✅</li>
    <li>Web-based – access your work from anywhere 🌐</li>
    <li>Super beginner-friendly and easy to pick up 🚀</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    </p>
    Figma is like the Google Docs of design, you can design, collaborate, and share in real time. And once you're
    comfortable with Figma, picking up other tools will feel much easier! So grab your curiosity and let’s begin this
    journey. Your first design is just a few clicks away 💡
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Getting started with Figma</h2>
    <p>
        So, let's get started with Figma!
<br><br><br>
To begin designing in Figma, you'll need to set up an account. You can easily create an account by visiting the Figma website and signing up. If you prefer, you can also use your Google account to sign in. Let us setup Figma first.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Setting up Figma</h2>
    <p>
        Look at the video below to setup your own Figma account to get started. <br>
<br>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ezldKx-jPag" title="Figma Tutorial for Beginners" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br><br>
The Video is originally 01:13:17 hour long. However u need to watch from 01:24 to 03:41. The video has been triggered to start and end at those points.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Figma's User Interface</h2>
    <p>
Once you've completed the setup, it is time to understand the interface of Figma. Watch the video given below to understand and learn about the interface in Figma.
<br><br>

<br><br>
The Video is originally 16:08 minutes long. However u need to watch from 01:24 to 06:02. The video has been triggered to start and end at those points.
<br><br><br>
Now that you've seen how Figma looks and works, let’s break it down into four key sections to help you navigate confidently:
<br><br>
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Toolbar (Top)</strong> This is where all your main tools are located — like Move, Frame, Shape, Pen, Text, and more. Think of it as your design toolbox. You’ll use these tools to draw, type, select, and structure your designs.</li>
<br><br>
<li><strong>Layers Panel (Left Sidebar)</strong> This panel shows the structure of your design — including frames, groups, and individual elements. It’s like a list of everything on your canvas, stacked in order. You can rename, group, hide, or rearrange elements easily from here.</li>
<br><br>
<li><strong>Canvas (Center)</strong> The canvas is your main design space. This is where your ideas come to life — you’ll be drawing shapes, placing text, arranging images, and more right here.</li>
<br><br>
<li><strong>Properties Panel (Right Sidebar)</strong> This area changes based on what you’ve selected. It lets you fine-tune details like position, size, colors (fill/stroke), text properties, effects, and more. It’s where your designs get their finishing touches.
</ol>
<br>
<p>
Now that you're familiar with the layout of Figma's interface, it’s time to dive into the tools that you'll actually use to create designs. These tools form the foundation of most UI elements and design structures. Go through the following concepts one by one, starting with shape tools.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Shape Tools</h2>
<p>
Figma provides a set of basic shape tools that allow you to build the building blocks of your design. These include rectangles, lines, ellipses (circles), polygons, stars, and more.
<br><br><br>
Use various shape tools to create different shapes and elements in your designs

<p>
Now that you've learned how to work with basic shapes, let’s take a step further and explore how to create custom shapes and paths. This is where the Pen Tool becomes incredibly useful.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Pen Tool Basics & Vector Networks</h2>
<p>
The Pen Tool may look simple, but it’s one of the most powerful tools in any designer’s toolkit. While shape tools help you create standard elements, the Pen Tool gives you complete freedom to draw whatever you imagine — from custom icons and illustrations to complex UI graphics.
<br><br><br>
Learn how to use the pen tool to create custom shapes and paths. Explore the power of vector networks.
</p>

<p>
Now that you know how to create both standard and custom shapes, it’s time to understand how to make your designs flexible and responsive. This is especially important when your UI needs to work on different screen sizes — and that’s where Constraints come in.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Constraints</h2>
<p>
Constraints help you control how elements behave when the frame or screen size changes. For example, if you want a button to stay centered, or an icon to remain pinned to the top-right corner of a card — constraints allow you to define those rules.
<br><br><br>
Try applying different constraints to shapes and frames to see how they react when resized. It’s a small feature with a big impact on your UI design skills.
<br><br><br>
Watch the video below to see constraints in action and how you can start using them in your own projects:

<br><br>
Great job! You’ve now explored the basics of Figma — from setting up your account to using shape tools, the pen tool, and constraints.
<br><br><br>
These are your first building blocks in UI design. Keep practicing, explore freely, and don’t worry about being perfect — you’re just getting started.
